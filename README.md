# PacMan-Exercise
Use JS, CSS, and HTML to create PacMen and have them randomly go across your screen.

This Project has a few components. You are required to use images and call them in your files in order to create PacMen. We use HTML and CSS to create a couple of buttons. These buttons have two functions, in which we use JavaScript to make them work. One button creates a new PacMan on the screem, the other makes the PacMen move in a randomized pattern and speed.


## Installing and Running Project

In order to run the project, please follow the following steps:

1 - Download all the files in the repository

2 - Open index.html file

3 - Click Add Pacman as needed

4 - Click Start Game for PacMen do move

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

In order to improve this project, in the future we can write code where each PacMan eats the other PacMan that it crosses paths with and they get larger and larger until only one very large one remains.
