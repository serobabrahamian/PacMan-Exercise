# PacMan-Exercise
Use JS, CSS, and HTML to create PacMen and have them randomly go across your screen.

This Project has a few components. You are required to use images and call them in your files in order to create PacMen. We use HTML and CSS to create a couple of buttons. These buttons have two functions, in which we use JavaScript to make them work. One button creates a new PacMan on the screem, the other makes the PacMen move in a randomized pattern and speed.
